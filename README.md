# YouTube-downloader-1080p-above
Download youtube videos above 720p with audio track

I wrote this halfhazard script because I am sick of the ad flood on YouTube and the instability of online video downloader webapps.

This script uses pytube and moviepy libraries.

Pytube cannot download videos above 1080p with original audio track. This script automates the process of downloading both the video and audio and combining them to produce the output video, and delete the by_product video and audio files.

pip install pytube, moviepy

Change the download folder directory at the top of the script

run: python yt.py

And follow instruction to download videos, more convenient for downloading videos above 1080p.
